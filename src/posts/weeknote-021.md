It was a short and sweet writing practice this week. It took me an hour and a half. It’s becoming easier with time, but I had a lot to process. The thoughts weren’t clear in my head enough to write it down.

My recommended article this week is Jay Kaufmann [notes about pronouns](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-problem-pronouns-heshe-theythem-whywhen-jay-kaufmann/).

## Good things

### Organising my first social for the DNA team

One of the things I love most about agile is the dedication to rituals. And the socials are a special one. A sweet memory I have about working in the UK was in a social when I prepared 23 caipirinhas for my team.

This week I organised my first social for the core design system team. No drinks, but we had so much fun. Our former Product Manager and content wizard Amy Hupe was our special guest. We also had the cute goats Shakin’ Susan, Cuthbert and Daisy attending our zoom. Good times.

### a11y and design operations on stage

Fred Warburton will share his [journey in accessibility](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/real-world-accessibility-stories-tickets-106217880540) next month. Fred’s experience is impressive and touching, and I had the privilege to watch him practising his talk.

I will also speak in a Meet-up next month. BT and Capital One will run the first DesignOps Virtual Meet-up in London. The original invitation was a few months ago, but COVID happened.

For a few weeks now, I am collecting ideas and facts to write this talk. It has been an interesting reflection exercise. I will share my ramblings about design management, culture and community 23rd of July. [Tickets are free](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/designops-virtual-meet-up-with-bt-capital-one-tickets-108683798166).

## Learned things

### Feedback loops, Mercury retrograde and servant leadership

360 performance review results were out this week. We had a great team retro, and it was quite revealing to see some patterns.

Intrigued by a piece of feedback shared by my teammates, I decided to call Rahel Bailie after work. Rahel, as always, listened to me with her candour, patience and positivism. Her jokes about astrology made my day.

Finding out my leadership style is a great challenge. The paradox of [servant leadership and ethical safeguards](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244019900562) is real. I have a lot to read and to learn.

### Equality and Equity

I watched Antionette D. Carroll talk at 99u Conference this week. She is the founder of the [Creative Reaction Lab](https://www.creativereactionlab.com/) in St. Louis, Missouri. Her speech was superb, and it felt like being struck by lightning:

> Those who are most directly impacted by inequities are also closest to the approaches to address them

## Things that bring me joy

### Souza origins and the detective work

I had a few more conversations with my dad and my aunt Celia about my ancestors. We are still trying to find more stories about my great-grandfather Bernardino. My dad shared with me an interesting fact about him. In his late life, he adopted Candomblé as his religion. Candomblé it is a syncretism. It mixes Roman Catholicism and Yoruba, a traditional West African religion. The rituals are exotic, and there is no concept of good or evil.

We also talked about my Grandfather, Oswaldo Souza Cunha.

### Banzo and Girls from Ipanema

After an intense week at work, I was still wired Friday night. Leili noticed my disorientation. She distracted me with fantastic food, music and good conversations.

We watched the first episode of [Girls from Ipanema](https://www.netflix.com/title/80208298). It’s a Netflix original production set in 1950s Rio de Janeiro. The life of four strong women fighting against sexism, racism and inequality. The lead character, Malu, opens a nightclub after being abandoned by her husband. A perfect excuse for the producers to introduce amazing music in the series. Great interpretation of jazz classics, bossa nova and Samba. Highly recommended.

Two excellent words are familiar to any Brazil ex-pat. The first one is saudade - which is missing someone or something you love. The other one is banzo \[1]. Taking with Leili triggered both. We talked about brazilian music, and she introduced me to a few new artists. Here is a selection of songs: \

Luedji Luna\
Liniker 

Sharing that banzo with Leili made me reflect how lucky I am. Having someone that loves you and makes you feel comfortable in any situation is a privilege. And to make things even better, our delivery from the Brazilian shop arrived. A great weekend ahead, indeed.
