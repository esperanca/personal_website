A few days ago, the content team in my previous workplace invited Giles Turnbull for a talk. Giles is a writer, and his book [The Agile Comms Handbook](https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/a-guide-to-agile-communication/) is precious. More recently, he shared about Weeknotes and the superpowers they enable in organizations. His talk inspired me to write here again after several months. I    
I have been writing this blog using a [custom weeknote format](https://gist.github.com/esperanca/5b91a7c64d6a1660cee2631759f425b7) I created for myself three years ago. However, I realized that the format prevents me from exploring new topics. This is precisely what Giles says about structure in one of his old posts with [tips for writing good weeknotes](https://gilest.org/weeknotes-tips.html).  
From now on, I will write shorter, sharper, and more personal posts. I might be completely shifting away from this blog's format and original intent. This one will be the last using the old format. Enjoy.

Computer vision and machine learning have improved, and many people have discussed applications to detect emotions based on facial expressions. Dr. David Matsumoto attempts to address some of the arguments against that. 
  
## Good things

### Making the healthcare experience human

I will soon complete six months of work at Docplanner. Their mission and values inspire me, and it is a joy to work in a scale-up again. It’s a world of possibilities, and the pace, for now, is ideal for me. 

I was asked to lead a strategic initiative as soon as I joined. I worked so hard — like I hadn’t for long. Since it was a greenfield opportunity, with little internal knowledge about the people we were designing for, I led the research strategy and conducted all interviews.
 
Using Indi Young’s Listening Sessions method again was so helpful. I met a group of inspiring women in Brazil and learned so much about what/how/why healthcare still sucks for many. 

After finishing that work, I could focus more on my team, which was very timely since we just finished the semester’s performance reviews. My small but mighty design team is lovely and spread over 3 countries: Poland, Spain and Germany.

I am lucky to say I already have people I can call friends at work. A good start, indeed. 


## Learned things
### Doing great work matters

This year, I am trying to balance resting, healing and creating good stuff. One of the most important lessons I have learned recently is that my spicy brain will never be fulfilled creatively working in a product team. I don’t have hobbies, so I enjoy doing great stuff in my free time.  

So, while this is a year of trying to be my best at work, I am committed to trying new things in my spare time that warm my heart. 

I recently finished my fourth cohort teaching service design online, which was rewarding. The fifth one happens in December, and there are a few spots available.  I am also creating another learning experience on voice interfaces this summer for a Portuguese design school. 

But the creative endeavour I am more excited about now is Secret Flavours. I am an assistant photographer, marketer, salesperson, UX intern, and Commis.    

Leili is the owner and head chef. She is also the love of my life, my muse, and everything for me. Her culinary talent and creativity are a gift to the world that needs to be shared.    
    
## Things that bring me joy

### Souza's are winning around the world 

Bia Souza smashed Brazil’s first gold medal this week. It was her first time competing in the Olympic games. While that might seem insignificant to many, it struck a chord with me, and I cried joyfully.

She is a perfect example of Brazilian grit and resilience. 

Bia’s father, Poseidonio, is a former judo athlete. Inspired by him, Bia has practised judo since she was seven years old. When she was a kid, she was uncomfortable with her body, and Judo helped her to build confidence. 

She won many medals before. In the Tokyo games, Maria Suelen Altheman, now her coach, beat her, so she was not selected for the games. And now she got there and rocked our world.   

Like 80% of the Brazilian athletes in Paris, Bia is supported by a government grant created by President Lula in 2004. 

I can’t stop thinking about how these fantastic black women are. The role models the new generations need. 

### Healthcheck

Diabetes is under control. Mental Health is ok.  
Weight: 93 kg
Food: The quality of the food in Spain is astounding. The tomatoes, fruits, cheeses. I am eating healthy as I can.  
Drinks: Had a few beers and some wine this month.
