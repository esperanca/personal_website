So many thoughts and ideas to share, but I can’t be writing for hours. Too hot. One of the best outcomes of the weeknotes habit is in the editing process. Take smart notes, but be selective with what you publish.

The blog post of this week is an old Lifehacker article. Something that Jane told me once and I am always trying to remember: [Assuming positive intent](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/assuming-positive-intent-the-ultimate-productivity-driver.html).

# Good things

## Operations lemonade

An exciting challenge in regards to research operations appeared this week. Emma Boulton is enjoying holiday so I had the opportunity to work with Anja Maerz and Dr Rosie Webster in the case. What stood out was the bold approach by Anja and Rosie. They not only solved the issue with speed and rigour but created the relational space and knowledge to propose a long term change.

## Sweet goodbye to lovely people

Friday was Elliot’s last day with us. And Mingxi will be leaving next Wednesday. I’ve spent time with them to reflect on the work and how they felt about their contributions. I am grateful for their openness and sincere approach.

# Learned things

## Network goggles

I found the [EuroIA line-up this week](https://euroia.eu/) in my twitter feed. My IXDA brother Jason Mesut is co-sharing. Great workshops and a spectacular talk by Peter Merholz. He proposes to use IA to org design practices.

He makes an interesting statement about the nature of Organisations. They are complex systems of people and information: Org charts, policies, roles and responsibilities, status reports, journey maps.

The obvious conclusion I am making is that Information spaces can make or break the experiences and services we create. Peter Morville, in Intertwingled, talks about the choices and cognitive costs of dealing with new information.

> “Many people may not want information, and they will avoid using a system precisely because it gives them information. Having information is painful and troublesome. We have all experienced this. If you have information, you must first read it, which is not always easy. You must then try to understand it. Understanding the information may show that your work was wrong, or may show that your work was needless. Thus not having and not using information can often lead to less trouble and pain.”

Information is hard. Context switching and reframing can be painful. The Wardley maps fella might disagree, but there is no playbook or doctrine to tackle this. We are all overwhelmed with information.

Two critical aspects of Design Operations have the potential to create long-lasting impact:

1. Constant effort to make information open, accessible and clear;
2. Purposefully build learning networks. Design best legacy is organisational memory, this goes way beyond shipping.   

On a side note, Julian Stood's Socially Dynamic Organisation inspired me. After reading it, I suggested a warm-up in our weekly XD Leads meeting. We designed a network map with the Experience Design team. It was fun, and I learned so much. Put your network goggles on, you will find so much novelty and opportunities.

# Things that bring me joy

## Green juice

This week we tried to get back to an old habit: green juices in the morning. Leili created this recipe that I try to replicate every day with little success. You need to mix one lemon, a bit of ginger, one carrot, half apple and kale. It doesn’t taste good, but it helps to reduce the sugar cravings.

## Healthcheck

With the heatwave, I had a few migraine episodes, but all is well now. Still struggling to get exams with the GP, but hopefully will make it next week.
