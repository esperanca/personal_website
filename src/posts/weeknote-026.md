After 25 weeks, I skipped writing my weeknotes for the first time. I had to write a lot of things about Design Operations and Strategy for a presentation. Much of it, I didn’t used in the final presentation. I was feeling exhausted. Skipping was the right thing to do: it allowed me some good reflection time. The post about the conference is on my backlog, but the slides are available.

My recommended blog post this week is by Indi Young, who doesn’t need introductions. In the post [Compassion is a type of empathy](https://indiyoung.com/compassion-is-a-type-of-empathy/) she introduces types of empathy and how it relates with compassion.



## Good things

### On compassionate colleagues

One of the things I enjoy most working at Babylon is the people. It’s a bunch o very talented ones, and the scope of different skills and knowledge is impressive. This week something also caught my attention: how empathetic and compassionate they are.

After an hour of a very dense user research session, I had to stop watching. The participant was an alternate timeline version of my deceased grandma. She was battling a chronic condition that I have as well. It was triggering me, and it took me some time to understand that. I have been doing design research for more than a decade for now, but research in healthcare is

As soon as the session finished, two lovely colleagues reached out. Dan Harvey and Emma Boulton, slacked me almost at the same time, to check-in. I am grateful for the kind humans I have the privilege to work with: they are not only smart but caring.

### Good principles

We are on our way to having a robust version of our design principles. The work started in our offsite last year, with a great session led by Ben Sauer.

This week we had a workshop with the entire team, to present a first draft of the themes. Kudos to Michael Delange, who led a significant part of this work and the team for the great contributions.

I had the opportunity to work with the team to develop the criteria we used to test design principles. I was so happy to see that we landed in a fantastic set of rules. I am planning to write a blog post soon.

A coincidence is that right after the workshop, I got a message from Ben Brignell. He is writing a book about design principles and curates [a website with a great list](https://principles.design/).

He shared with me an excellent example of how to test if a principle is memorable. He is writing a blog post about this topic, so I will not spoil the surprise.

### Advanced Markdown with Elliot

Our developer, Elliot, is leaving next week. Of course, we could not be happy with simple handover notes. Elliot suggested to teach us advanced markdown tricks. It will allow non-developers to publish any documentation in our design system. Learning something complex was fun and rewarding, and just spending time learning things with Lindsey and Fred Warbz was great.

## Learned things

### Be kind with yourself

I have my dream therapist, Helena, this Wednesday. Every session, I learn something valuable, and our time together is always great. We had a conversation about the things I’ve learned this year about myself. It was a revelation moment for me.

The year I’ve learned not only how to be more flexible with others, but also with myself. How to control my expectations about myself when I am not in my best moments. The year I’ve learned about my limits like never before.

Many others helped me with this, but Helena’s approach was pivotal. Get a therapist: you will never regret

### Unstructured peer mentoring

In Brasília, about five years ago, I met three brothers who work creating things for the web. Estevão Lucas and Angelo Lucas are developers, and Rafael Lucas, a designer. We worked together in a few projects in different agencies, and we became friends.

Recently, I tried to hire Rafael to the Design System role available in my team. He was not interested in relocating to the UK, but the conversation was great. We decided to trial a peer mentoring experiment.

He will teach me CSS again. We are redesigning Leili’s website to improve accessibility and performance. And I am keen to design proper responsive breakpoints. In exchange, I will help him with design, accessibility, and business English.

## Things that bring me joy

### Quarantine love

With the impossibility of travelling as we always do, we are making the effort of being comfortable in our lockdown. Leili pampers me so much. This week we tried new pillows, she bought special grapes for me and cooked my favourite pork steak—all of this while writing her book and shooting amazing photos.

### Using the force

I have treated myself with a new game this week: Vader Immortal, Episode 2. The plot is about meeting Darth Vader and learning the Jedi tricks. In Episode 1, you learn how to use a lightsaber. In this one, is all about using the force to manipulate objects. It is awesome. The sound design is incredible, and the haptic feedback interaction is so cool. ILM is the real inventors of transmedia storytelling. The entire world-building and story is impressive.

### Healthcheck

I am having some trouble with my diabetes this week and some migraine attacks due to the heatwave.

Weight: 98 kg
Food: Great week, with my favourite salad and home-cooked rice.
Drinks: One Caipirinha
Smoking: 8 juul pods.
