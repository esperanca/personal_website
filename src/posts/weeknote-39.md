Since July, I’ve invested my time in redesigning this website instead of writing. I love designing and coding stuff because I can. There is still a lot to do, but it was an exciting side project, and I had help from a brilliant bunch.

Hope you like it, and please send any [feedback](/contact). Priority is for accessibility improvements. But visual and interaction design comments are valid.

[Teach Slower to Teach Better](https://www.moderniststudio.com/corporate-education/teach-slower-to-teach-better/)

Jon Kolko is a designer and founder of the Austin Center for Design. This article about how designers learn and the issue of quality versus speed is so inspiring.

[Cancel your meetings](https://www.mmhmm.app/events/#cancel-your-meetings)

Phil Libin is the founder of mmhmm. It’s a tool that aims to transform video meetings and presentations. In this talk, he explores the value of asynchronous updates. There is also an interesting point about the speed we process information these days.

Inayaili De León shares a lot of wisdom in her 2018 talk at the Design Systems London conference. Build a style guide, and the essential component library is way easier than making a living design system. This work is more complicated, unpredictable. There is no such thing as the right way of doing things, but some good practices always help.

## Good things

### Probation complete

It’s funny how in some places, people don’t celebrate the end of probation. I am happy to announce that I have now completed my probation at Farfetch. I’ve learned a bit about luxury and fashion, but still dressing like a very creative homeless person. I’ve learned a lot about the culture and our people. There is excellent support from the team, and having this great chap called Justin to call boss is a privilege.

### Work, love and productive conflict

Last year our team created a process for long term strategic work. It’s an innovative approach to intertwine research and sprint activities. Improving part of this process was my first mission when I was hired. I spent the last months changing the process while something important was happening that required said process to be ready. Not ideal, but it worked well. I had the privilege of joining the team in the first pilot to put in place the change.

I was in charge of the facilitation and planning, working with a Head of Design, a Principal and a Lead Researcher. Together we learned a lot about storytelling, async work and ideation activities.

There were some moments where I did some hands-on work as well, which was something extraordinary for me. Design Operations work can be tedious sometimes. I frequently miss the simplicity and the joy of delivering design work and creating beauty and structure.

In the retrospective we had last week, the feedback about facilitation, structure, and energy was very positive. Product leaders and the team itself were pretty happy with the outcomes. Feedback from users was positive.

It was my first time working directly with one of my reports, Paddy. He is the living definition of a cool cat. I shared with him some facilitation tricks and we tested new tools to improve collaboration and equal participation in workshops. Psychological safety, love, and a bit of productive conflict are core ingredients for quality design work. I am happy to say we made it.

### A lens a day #42 - slow change

Wonderful Dan Brown invited me to a chat about Information Architecture. Dan is one of the luminaries in the IA Community and the founder of Eightshapes. His book Communicating Design helped me a lot a decade ago.

He created IA Lenses, a deck with 51 cards to help practitioners with perspectives when designing information architecture. Recently, he decided to invite Information Architects around the world to discuss the lenses in a [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wESCpbgyp8&list=PL6FSU6AFQFEU3pJ12rxs3U1hGS2yx3O3T) that is also available as a [podcast](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjModzXi5rzAhXOgVwKHavaDX8QFnoECBYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fshow%2F2saemBQZKAzRGuDhO9y8Hi&usg=AOvVaw3A2qPoms-dWt_-5QwUFAVH).

The topic we talked about was slow change, which I was honestly not prepared to talk about. But with great interviewing skills and low expectations, Dan put me at ease at the beginning of the call. We touched on topics like agile, service design and the opportunity to apply IA in a holistic context to enable sustainable change. The [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ALHa_DdOMo) was recorded during my holidays. The video quality is not great but the audio is quite good.   

## Learned Things

### Meaning is pain

I have been thinking a lot about finding happiness. At work, at life, in my relationships. Besides being a self-proclaimed pissed-off optimist, I confess that I have been overwhelmed recently and a bit lost on the meaning of life.

I see my family, friends and colleagues being hurt (or dying) due to idiocy and politics. Staying happy in my privilege bubble while the world falls apart isn’t easy. I am tired.

My therapist, Helena, is helping me to cope with these philosophical dilemmas. It might sound like a truism, but here it is: everything that carries meaning will definitely bring painful moments. If change is the only thing that remains constant, pain is the sidekick holding a lantern.

If you are interested in digging into this, perhaps you will find some joy and reflection [reading this post](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-differences-between-happiness-and-meaning-in-life/) from Scientific American.

### The great resignation and communication breakdown

Everyone is talking about the great resignation. Corporations are struggling to provide a sense of safety and fair participation to employees in regard to the decisions on remote work.

It baffles me that in 2021 we are still having discussions about this. It’s not that hard, really. Policy change is a service design challenge — it feels we have learned nothing about how governments handled the COVID catastrophe. Kudos to Jacinta and New Zealand, the only country that really nailed it. 

Even [Apple is having trouble](https://www.vox.com/recode/22690190/apple-remote-work-from-home-employee-cher-scarlett-janneke-parrish). This article published today at Vox is enlightening: it explains so much about the arrogance that comes with power and what is really behind these decisions.

Perhaps the only FAANG that is not having so much trouble on this is Facebook. Since June, they acted fast and opened the work at home policy to all employees after trying to enforce some rules in May.

The back story of the war on talent is that sad, really. Millions making bad decisions. The uncomfortable truth is that the changes in how we work are happening fast, and leadership and management aren’t able to cope.

I am navigating this theme and doing what I can. Having honest conversations with my team and learning more and more about asynchronous work. We have pleanty of possibilities and ways of solving this charade. But the solutions will require more empathy and flexibility.

## Things that bring me joy

### Late summer in Crete

Burn-out isn’t something that you recover fully quickly. I am still recovering from the things that happened with me last march. A few weeks ago, I was feeling the blues and stressed. Leili, my lovely partner, noticed this. She planned a holiday, and we travelled to Greece. We had terrific days enjoying good food and a real summer. I spent a week reading Nick Scalding books and listening to music. Soaking in the beach, just breathing fresh air and drinking orange juice. I can’t wait for the next one.

### A day in the office, again

Thursday, I visited the office again, and I’ve met people from Product for the first time. It was nice to see them in 3D, having some tea and high fives and hugs. It was a joy to find out we have a library and I also had lunch with Justin and Rufus. 

### Leili’s book is ready

My wife just finished her first book, Cheiro Verde. I’ve had the pleasure to eat 80% of all recipes, and I have to say: it’s all delicious. Now I am planning to help her with the printing production and marketing. She is aiming to launch this year in Brasil. One of the recipes of the book it’s available in English: you can learn how to bake Pao de Queijo (Cheese bread)

### Healthcheck

Since my last post, so many things have happened in this area. I had another diabetes review, with some improvement in how I am managing the condition. On the other hand, long COVID is still a thing for me. The same old weird shit like parosmia, fatigue and tinnitus.
