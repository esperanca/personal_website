Enjoying a bit of a break and the hot weather in Spain.

## Good things
### Podcasting
I had a random call with an old friend recently. Juliano Spyer (Juca) is a great conversationalist, writer and anthropologist. I had the opportunity to hang out with him in São Paulo and London several times. He is such a fantastic person to talk to and full of exciting stories. 
One of the things I have learned with Juca is how to share your thinking on the web. 

Most people will be surprised, but I used to be shy and nervous speaking to audiences. That changed after working with Juca and other talented people at Talk2. 

When we worked together, Juca led a project called Talk Show, a podcast in which we interviewed "digital" people. 
It was recorded live on Twitter, with incredible hacks to capture Skype calls, broadcast, and capture questions—something you can do easily with an app today. 

Many episodes are missed now - it has been over 15 years! But I recovered a quote from one where Juca interviewed Andrew Keen. Andrew was publishing his book The Cult of the Amateur at the time. The book critiques the impact of user-generated content in the society. You can hear the entire [episode](https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/talkshow/episodes/2009-06-03T10_09_50-07_00) (skip the first 5 minutes if you don;t understand portuguese) but I wanna share a quote about the web and business models:

> "Clay Shirky and I are friends, and it's interesting because many people think we disagree on most things. We agree     on most things. He's right. And he's coming closer to my position. Because the assumption was three or four or five years ago that the old media would die and be replaced painlessly by   new media, this massive seismic shift from newspapers to bloggers, from the movie business or the television business to YouTubers. And that hasn't happened. In my book, I argued that the old was dying, but nothing new was replacing it. And that's even truer today. Old media is in crisis. Still, no viable business models exist to build new media companies."  

Clay Shirky point that Andrew was mentioning was related to the idea of value generated by communities. He talks that "the absence of a business model actually allowed the creation of a value that the presence of a business model prevented".

It's interesting to see how this conversation aged. We have now have other risks and benefits that we could not imagine in 2009. I can't wait to call Juca again and discuss this topic. 

Creating content is not a viable business for many, and that is okay. I still see the role of writing and sharing great content as an opportunity to be generous with the web community that you serve. Over time, it creates value that can't be directly connected with engagement metrics.

It's a way to create serendipity and connection that can't be (yet) provided by machine learning algorithms. It reminds me of the seminal idea that "markets are conversations" and marketplaces have an important role nurturing communities.    


## Learned things
### Maslow and the Blackfoot 
I have been researching about the topic of "user needs". I am using ironic quotes here as I find the term extremely reductive. But I disgress. In my research, I was reading the famous "A Theory of Human Motivation" paper by Abraham Maslow. Maslow is well know for his Hierarchy of Needs. But according to this amazing article, Maslow himself never thought about his [hierarchy](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2021-06-18/the-blackfoot-wisdom-that-inspired-maslows-hierarchy/) of needs as a pyramid. And that his theories were probably influenced by the Siksika Blackfoot way of life.   

> "According to Blood and Heavy Head’s lectures (2007), 30-year-old Maslow arrived at Siksika along with Lucien Hanks and Jane Richardson Hanks. He intended to test the universality of his theory that social hierarchies are maintained by dominance of some people over others. However, he did not see the quest for dominance in Blackfoot society. Instead, he discovered astounding levels of cooperation, minimal inequality, restorative justice, full bellies, and high levels of life satisfaction." 

I am always impressed with the wisdom of the First Nations. The key lesson in the article is the communal aspect of fullfilling needs. More on user needs and this reseach in the end of this post. 

    
## Things that bring me joy
### Swimming
I never thought I would appreciate swimming that much, but here we are. With 40 degrees in Valencia, it's becoming a good habit with positive effects on my health. Sometimes I am feeeling adventurous and I go to Malvarrosa. Be in the water, my friend.  

### Web Designing
Working with Leili in her business has been a joy. This week we redesigned her [website](https://www.secretflavours.com). After using markdown and eleventy for years, it was quite hard to get used to wordpress blocks and all those bells and whistles. But it's live, we moved out of Squarespace. And now we are ready for the next stage: evolving the content, localization and the marketing strategy. Onward.

[The neuroscience of trust](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-neuroscience-of-trust)
In “The Neuroscience of Trust,” Paul J. Zak breaks down how trust is the secret sauce for boosting employee engagement, productivity, and retention. He says companies that build trust see big wins—like 50% more productivity and 76% more engagement. Zak’s research highlights eight trust-building moves for managers. 

[Abductive reasoning in research](https://atlasti.com/research-hub/abductive-reasoning)
In product, we always discuss the topic of evidence-based decision making. But teams learn in different ways, and all thinking tools are welcome. This definition of abductive reasoning and how it compares to inductive and deductive reasoning is refreshing: 

> "Abductive reasoning is a logical process where one starts with an observation and then seeks the simplest and most likely candidate explanations. Unlike other forms of reasoning that start with a theory or observation that cannot be explained by any existing theory, abductive reasoning begins with an unexpected fact or occurrence and works backward-and-forward to find the most plausible theory." 

[Perceiving Needs](https://fastefoundation.org/publications/perceiving_needs.pdf)
Professor Rolf Faste explored the same question I have: the difference between needs and wants. The paper is from 1987! This quote about how the discovery of needs impact the health of the teams is epic:  

> "A clearly defined need also attracts talent and provides motivation for employees. Thus needs are not just a sales issue, but significantly affect the entire health of the organization. Just as they do for students, good
problems generate energy: they attract the best people and the best efforts of the entire organization"
