A lot happened since my last post in November 23. 8 jobs interviews. Received my british citizen. Found a job in Spain. Applied for a work visa. Found a new flat. Moved to Valencia. It was intense and not always easy. Now that everything is settled. I am doing my best to find balance and enjoy life. 
New city, new job, and a new language to learn.

## Good things

### Hola Valencia!

It's my second month living in Valencia next Monday. Moving out of London after eight years was not an easy decision. I miss my friends there, the design community and the art. But Valencia it's growing  in my heart in a way I was not expecting. 
Besides the [Kafkaesque](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myh_GWyliXU) experience of obtaining my working visa. I feel confident about this decision, particularly after the recent news from the UK.     
Living near the beach was always something I dreamed of. I am not dipping in the Mediterranean Sea with the frequency I need. But just riding my bike to Malvarrosa whenever I want makes me smile. 
Another quality-of-life improvement is having old friends who care for you now living within walking distance. We are so lucky to have Lady Cabanyal and Don Bumface (not using their real names to protect their privacy) to hang out frequently. Their help navigating the Spanish bureaucracy and learning about the local culture made all the difference. 
Learning Spanish, a language that I never had any curiosity before, has been good. It has many similarities with old Brazilian Portuguese. It is poetic, rich and sometimes fun. I am impressed with the locals, they are usually warm and receptive. Even when I torture them with my portuñol.  

### Making the healthcare experience human

This week I am completing six months working at Docplanner. The mission and values inspired me to join. It has been a joy to work in a scale-up again.   

I was assigned to lead a strategic initiative as soon as I joined. I worked so hard — like I hadn’t for long. Since it was a greenfield opportunity, with little internal knowledge about the people we were designing for, I was responsible for the research strategy and conducted all interviews. Using Indi Young’s Listening Sessions method was so helpful. I listened to a group of inspiring women in Brazil and learned so much about what/how/why healthcare is still so hard for so many. We sprinted. We tested. We argued. I feel people are excited about the learnings and the challenges. I am quite optimistic.  

More recently, I have been refocusing my time on my small but mighty design team. They are spread over 3 countries: Poland, Spain and Germany. All of them are lovely, talented and unique.    

I am lucky to say I think I have already people I can call friends at work. A good start. 


## Learned things
### Doing great work matters

This year, I am trying to balance resting, healing and creating good stuff. One of the most recent lessons for me is that my spicy brain is never satisfied with my regular, salaried work. Doing great stuff in my free time feels awesome. Doing things in my spare time warms my heart. Writing, teaching, consulting, mentoring, hacking.    

The first time I thought about this I started to teach professionally.  I recently finished my fourth cohort teaching service design online, which was rewarding. I am teaching the same course in November, and there are a few spots available and the full information in the [Experience Haus](https://experiencehaus.com/course/service-design-online-course/) website. I am also have been invited to create a voice interface training this summer. I have done something similar before in portuguese, with the mentorship of my friend Ben Sauer.    

But the creative endeavour I am more excited about now is [Secret Flavours](https://www.secretflavours.com). I am an assistant photographer, marketer, salesperson, UX intern, and Commis. This week we had two sessions where people tested our menu. Inspired by Bahia, the three course menu was crowned by a Moqueca Baiana (fish stew with brazilian ingredients, shrimp. Some say it's similar to a light curry). Reviews are positive, but there is some work to do. Marketing and selling experiences is not an easy task.       

Leili is the owner and head chef. Her creativity and culinary talent and creativity are a gift to the world that needs to be shared. She is also the love of my life, my muse, and everything for me.     
    
## Things that bring me joy

### Souza's are winning around the world 

![Bia Souza, Olympic Gold Medal - Paris 2024](/images/biasouza.jpeg "Bia Souza, olympic athlete, celebrates her victory in Paris")

Bia Souza smashed Brazil’s first gold medal this week. It was her first time competing in the Olympic games. While that might seem insignificant to many, it struck a chord with me, and I cried joyfully. When I was a kid, I trained judo for 6 months, and I loved. 

Bia’s father, Poseidonio, is a former judo athlete. Inspired by him, Bia has practised judo since she was seven years old. When she was a kid, she was uncomfortable with her body, and Judo helped her to build confidence. 

She won many medals before but not in the Olympic Games. In Tokyo, Maria Suelen Altheman, now her coach, beat her, and she was not selected for the games. And now she got there and rocked our world.

Bia is the perfect example of Brazilian grit and resilience. 

Like 80% of the Brazilian athletes in Paris, Bia is supported by a government grant created by President Lula in 2004. 

I can’t stop thinking about how these fantastic black women are. The role models the new generations need. 

### Healthcheck

Diabetes is under control. Mental Health is ok. My lovely therapist, Helena, discharged me.  

Weight: 93 kg

Food: The quality of the food in Spain is astounding. The tomatoes, fruits, cheeses. I am eating healthy as I can.  

Drinks: Had a few beers and some wine this month.

[Occupational health and safety management — Psychological health and safety at work — Guidelines for managing psychosocial risks](https://www.iso.org/standard/64283.html)
There is an ISO Standard for psychological safety and I find that fascinating. It talks about wellbeing at work, psychosocial risks and how to identify hazards and minimize the risks associated with them. It's a shame it's under a paywall, but that is why we have Anna's Archive. 

[How to go on an information Diet, by Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com/information-diet)
> "Information is a drug. From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense: the more information our ancestors had, the more likely they were to survive. But this is the first time in history that humans have been exposed to such a constant flow of information. And in the same way the superabundance of high-calorie foods has led to obesity, this new information overload encourages overconsumption". 

Anne-Laure is so smart!   

[Content Operations: The Invisible Scaffold You Can’t Live Without](https://www.fenwick.media/all-blog-posts/what-is-content-operations)
This article it's an interesting introduction to the topic. It's focused on Marketing, so it doesn't cover the complexities of global product teams. On this topic, the book [Content Operations at Scale](https://publishing.vt.edu/site/books/e/10.21061/content_operations_evia/) is more helpful. If you are into podcasts, listen this episode [Defining Content Operations](https://player.captivate.fm/episode/18c97655-adef-4e9e-a489-54b16f272253) with my dear Content Empress, Rahel Bailie, who wrote the first chapter.
