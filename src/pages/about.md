I was born in Minas Gerais, a Brazilian region well known for its great coffee, cheese and their talkative inhabitants. 

In the last ten years, I have lived in six different cities. The most interesting one was for sure, Marabá, in the legal Amazon. My favourite is still Brasília, capital of Brazil. I moved to the UK in 2016, and I live in London with my lovely and talented wife, Leiliane Valadares.  

I am design nexialist. Learning new things and making connections across disciplines excites me. I consider myself an Information Architect and Design Researcher - the primary lenses I use to make things better. 

My goal is to bring clarity and simplicity so teams can be creative and connected. I use simple language and information architecture to decode complexity. Processes, services, digital experiences or even organisations.

Currently, I work with executives and design leaders building and scale high-performing teams.
