I was born in Minas Gerais, a Brazilian region well known for its great coffee, cheese and their talkative inhabitants. 

Is my birthplace and a considerable influence on my personality. The curiosity and the flair for exploration of my people is something I am proud to carry on. I started creating experiences for the web in 1998 and I never stopped. I am not yet a digital nomad, but this is something I have been thinking a lot for decades and I move a lot.  

In the last ten years, I have lived in six different cities. The most interesting one was for sure, Marabá, in the legal Amazon. My favourite is still Brasília, capital of Brazil. I moved to the UK in 2016, and I live in London with my lovely and talented wife, Leiliane Valadares.  

I am design generalist. Learning new things and making connections across disciplines excites me. I consider myself an Information Architect and Design Researcher -- the primary lenses I use to make things better. 

My goal is to bring clarity and simplicity so teams can be creative and connected. I use simple language and information architecture to decode complexity. It can be anything: a process, a service, a digital experience or an organisation.

I lead the Design Operations practice at Babylon Health. We are creating accessible and affordable healthcare for the world.
