Since 1998, I have designed digital products, which means inventing processes, services, experiences and organisations. 
Recently, I led product and service design teams at Publicis Sapient, Babylon Health, Farfetch, British Telecom and Doctoralia. 

My experience spans financial services, consulting, healthcare, media, e-commerce and telecommunications.

I am a collaboration specialist. I help teams creating clarity, supporting structures and safe spaces. 

Executives and design leaders hire me when they need to scale design and research teams or when they need someone to lead high-stakes projects as lead designer or strategist.
