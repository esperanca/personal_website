Since 1998 I have been designing processes, services, digital experiences and organisations. I have led global teams at consultancies and tech teams. I consider myself an Information Architect and Design Researcher, but I have had many titles. The most recent ones:
 
Creative Director (Isobar and Publicis Sapient)
Director of Design Operations (Babylon Health) 
Head of Design (Farfetch and now British Telecom)  
 
Working in-house or with clients, my experience spans a few verticals: financial services, consulting, healthcare, media, e-commerce and telecommunications. 

Learning new things and making connections across design disciplines excites me. I bring clarity and simplicity so my teams can be creative and connected. I have designed digital services and experiences for start-ups, scale-ups and corporations, but ultimately what I do is to design successful collaboration and supporting structures for design and product teams.

Currently, I work with executives and design leaders scaling design and research teams.
