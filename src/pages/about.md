Since 1998, I have been designing processes, services, digital experiences and organisations. 
Recently, I led product and service design teams at:  

* Farfetch - Senior Design Manager
* Babylon Health - Senior Design Manager
* Publicis Sapient - Associate Creative Director, Experience Design


My experience in digital projects spans financial services, consulting, healthcare, media, e-commerce and telecommunications.

I am a collaboration specialist. Creating clarity, supporting structures and safe spaces that make design and product teams work efficiently. I generally work with distributed teams globally. I live in London, UK. 

Executives and design leaders hire me when they need to scale design and research teams or when they need someone to lead high stakes projects as lead designer or strategist. 

Currently I am Head of Design at EE (British Telecom) and a service design teacher at Experience Haus.
