I've been designing digital products since 1998. This involves creating new processes, services, and experiences and rethinking how organizations work.

Recently, I've led product and service design teams at companies such as Publicis Sapient, Babylon Health, Farfetch, British Telecom, and Doctoralia. 

My experience covers various industries: financial services, consulting, healthcare, media, e-commerce, and telecommunications.

I help teams creating clarity, building supportive structures, and fostering safe spaces for innovation. My core skills are design direction, information architecture and design research.

Design executives and leaders often hire me when they need to scale their design and research teams. Or when they require an experienced hands-on design leader to drive high-stakes projects. 


## Currently
