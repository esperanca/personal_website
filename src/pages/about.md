Since 1998, I have been designing processes, services, digital experiences and organisations. I am an Information Architect and Design Researcher. Recently, I led product and service design teams at:  

Farfetch - Senior Design Manager
Babylon Health - Senior Design Manager
Publicis Sapient - Associate Creative Director, Experience Design


My experience spans financial services, consulting, healthcare, media, e-commerce and telecommunications.

My speciality is creating the clarity, supporting structures and collaboration spaces that make design and product teams work efficiently. I generally work with distributed teams globally and I currently living in London, UK. 

Executives and design leaders typically hire me when they need to scale design and research teams or when they need someone to lead high-risk projects as lead designer or strategist. 

Currently I am Head of Design at EE (British Telecom) and service design teacher at Experience Haus.
