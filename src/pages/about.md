Since 1998, I have been designing processes, services, digital experiences and organisations. I am an Information Architect and Design Researcher, but I have had many titles. The most recent ones:

Associate Creative Director, Experience Design (Isobar and Publicis Sapient)
Director of Design Operations (Babylon Health)
Head of Design (Farfetch and now British Telecom)

Working in-house or with clients, my experience spans financial services, consulting, healthcare, media, e-commerce and telecommunications. 

Learning new things and making connections across design disciplines excites me. I bring clarity and simplicity so my teams can be creative and connected.
My speciality is creating the clarity, supporting structures and collaboration spaces that make design and product teams work efficiently. I generally work with distributed teams globally but live in London, UK. 

Executives and design leaders typically hire me when they need to scale design and research teams or when they need someone to lead high-risk projects. 

Currently, I teach Service Design online at Experience Haus and work full-time at EE/British Telecom.
