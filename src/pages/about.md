I was born in Minas Gerais, a Brazilian region well known for its great coffee, cheese and their talkative inhabitants. 

Is my birthplace and a considerable influence on my personality. The curiosity and the flair for exploration of my people is something I am proud to carry on. 

In the last ten years, I have lived in six different cities. The most interesting one was for sure, Marabá, in the legal Amazon. My favourite is still Brasília, capital of Brazil. I moved to the UK in 2016, and I live in London with my lovely and talented wife, Leiliane Valadares.  

I am a self-taught design generalist. I am usually excited about learning new things and making connections across disciplines. I consider myself an Information Architect and Design Researcher. I have been working in agencies and consultancies as a Creative Director, Content Strategist, UX Lead, Planner and Community Manager. 

My goal is always to bring clarity and simplicity, and I use simple language and information architecture to decode complexity. I can simplify anything: a process, a service, a digital experience or an organisation.

Currently, I am leading the Design Operations practice and the Design Systems team at Babylon Health. We are creating accessible and affordable healthcare for the world.
