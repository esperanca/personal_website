I've been designing digital products since 1998. This involves creating new processes, services, and experiences and rethinking how organizations work.

Recently, I've led product and service design teams at companies such as Publicis Sapient, Babylon Health, Farfetch, British Telecom, and Doctoralia. 

My experience covers various industries: financial services, consulting, healthcare, media, e-commerce, and telecommunications.

I enhance team productivity by cultivating an environment that promotes experimentation and innovation. My expertise spans design direction, information architecture, and comprehensive design research, focusing on creating psychological safety and robust support systems.

Design executives and leaders often hire me when they need to scale their design and research teams or when they need an experienced, hands-on design lead to drive high-stakes projects. 


## Currently
