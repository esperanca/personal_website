Design executives and leaders often hire me when they need to scale their design and research teams. Or when they need an experienced, hands-on design lead to drive high-stakes projects. 

For over two decades, I've been designing digital products. This involves creating new services, experiences, and processes - rethinking how organizations work.

I've led product, content and service design teams at Babylon Health, Farfetch and British Telecom. I have also worked in consultancies like Publicis Sapient, Isobar and Wunderman.

My experience covers a range of industries, from financial services, healthcare, media, and e-commerce to telecommunications.

One of my core strengths is enhancing team productivity by cultivating an environment that promotes experimentation and innovation. I focus on creating psychological safety and robust support systems.

My expertise spans design direction, information architecture, and design research.
