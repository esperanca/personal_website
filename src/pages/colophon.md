How we made this website

This site is designed and written by me, from London. I use Figma, IAWriter and Roam Research. I use a Mac Mini with a Thunderbolt display. I am grateful for the amazing folks that supported me on this project.

The excellent Yuri Del Duca helped me with typography. Typeset used is Playfair Display and Noto Sans, provided by Google Fonts.

My profile photo was taken by Leiliane Valadares.

The illustration in the home was created by Saulo Cruz. CSS and 11ty implementation by [Yinka Adedire](https://twitter.com/yinkakun).

This site is powered by Hylia and hosted by Netlify
